Challenge One: Code Refactor

Description:
This project is an HTML page with CSS styling for the marketing group Horiseon. It has been edited to be more accessible. The HTML and CSS have been cleaned up to be more organized and comments were added. Broken links were fixed, alts were added to the images, and a title was also added for the page.
